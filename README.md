### What I learned

I didn't have much trouble with the CSS part. I got stuck a bit on the colored part of the cards. Initially, I did it using a pseudo-element, but then I changed it later. This part took some time. In the JS part, rendering the view also took a while. In my first code, I could see the view when I clicked on the daily or weekly section, but when I loaded the page, the activities didn't show up. However, I realized I only needed a single function I hadn't noticed. I think I won't get stuck on this part for so long in my future projects.It was quite a fun project.
